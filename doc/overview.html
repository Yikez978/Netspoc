<h3>a Network Security Policy Compiler</h3>
<HR>
<h2><A NAME="description">Description</A></h2>

NetSPoC is a tool for security managment of large computer networks
with different security domains. It generates configuration files for
packet filters controlling the borders of security domains.

<P>NetSPoC provides its own <A HREF="language.html">language</A> for
describing the security policy and topology of a network. The security
policy is a set of rules that state which packets are allowed to pass
the network and which not. NetSPoC is topology aware: a rule for
traffic from A to B is automatically applied to all managed packet
filters on the path from A to B.

<P>Currently NetSPoC generates ACLs and static routing entries for
<ul>
<li>Cisco routers with or without firewall feature set,
<li>Cisco ASA and PIX firewalls,
<li>Linux iptables and ip route. 
</ul>
It supports network address translation, virtual IP addresses for
redundancy protocols like VRRP and some dynamic routing protocols.

<p>IPSec encryption is supported as well. Crypto configuration for
Cisco IOS routers and ASA firewalls is generated.

<P>NetSPoC's text based specification language is well suited for integration
with CVS or other version control systems. A script is provided for tagging a
policy and saving it to a policy database.

<P>This software is actively developed with perl 5.12 under linux. It should be
portable to other platforms where perl is available.
