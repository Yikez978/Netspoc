ToDo list for NetSPoC, a Network Security Policy Compiler

- Make NetSPoC aware of network address translation
  - dynamic with pools
  - static for hosts and networks

- In a second step generate NAT code

- Code generation for IOS routers without firewall feature set

- Description and code generation for IPSec tunnels

- Consider if managed router should be seen as an own small security
  domain with better isolation from the directly connected networks. 

- Separate NetSPoC functionality into a perl module. This would allow
  to build some interesting query tools:
  - policy query: give a description of a data packet and answer if it
    is allowed to pass with the current policy.
  - Which rules are applicable to a network object?
  - What are the managed routers between A and B?

- Give a graphical reprensentation of the topology, for example using
  the graphviz library (http://www.graphviz.org/).

- Allow the network toplogy to have loops.
  This has low priority for me.
  I think this change would introduce much more complicated
  algorithms.
