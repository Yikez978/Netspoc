        means all networks from area:a without network:n

2007-12-07  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * Netspoc.pm: 
	A VPN router for remote office can now be used as a backup
	mechanism for larger locations. But only traffic from the directly
	attached network is allowed to cross the VPN router. This can be
	achieved by tunneling all the other traffic throug a GRE tunnel.

2007-11-09  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * start-jobs: + eval $line

        * Netspoc.pm: Added minimal POD

        * Netspoc.pm: Added a standard $VERSION variable for this module.

        * Netspoc.pm: Introduced loopback interfaces:
        - no attached network
        - no ACLs generated
        - declared by additional attribute 'loopback'
        - limited set of attributes allowed: ip, hardware, nat
        - Loopback interfaces of different routers may share the same name
          e.g. router:r1.loop and router:r2.loop
        - a loopback interface may be used in rules like other interfaces.
        - Interface and network with identical IP address is no longer allowed.
        Rules with service having src_path or dst_path flag:
        - Auto interfaces are supported now.
        Rules with service having src_net or dst_net flag:
        - 'Any' objects are no longer rejected but left unchanged.
        - Hosts having a vpn id are left unchanged.
        - Interfaces of manged routers are left unchanged.

2007-11-02  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * Netspoc.pm:
        Check for interface and network having equal IP adress now is done for
	/32 mask as well.

2007-11-01  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * cut-netspoc: adapted to new Netspoc.pm
        - path_auto_interfaces
        - no every objects
        - group any:local no longer exists.

        * Netspoc.pm: 
	- Extended auto interfaces:
          - added [back] to denote interfaces at the back side.
          - renamed [auto] to [front]
        - Extended syntax for 'automatic' objects and object-groups:
          - interface:[network:xx].[all|front|back]
            select all or some interfaces of a network.
          - interface:[interface:xx.yy].[all|front|back]
            equivalent to interface:xx.[all|front|back];
            may be useful if inner interface is result of group expansion.
          - network:[interface:xx.yy]
            the network attached to an interface.
          - network:[host:xx]
            the network attached to a host.
          - network:[network:xx]
            the network itself;
            may be useful if inner network is result of group expansion.
          - any:[interface:xx.yy]
          - any:[host:xx]
          - any:[network:xx]
          - any:[any:xx]
            The security domain where the inner object is located.
          - Additionally, a list of objects or groups may be given 
	    as value in brackets
            e.g. network:[host:x1, host:x2, group:other_hosts]
          - interface:[managed & ... ].[all|front|back]
            Result is restricted to managed interfaces.
        - Restriction for auto interfaces:
          Auto interfaces, i.e. with [front] or [back] must only be used 
	  at toplevel and not as inner object of other automatic objects.
          There is one exception from this rule:
          interface:[interface:xx.[front|back]].[xx] is allowed. 
	  In this case the inner selector is ignored and the outer 
	  selector xx is used.
        - An area can now be defined with anchor but without auto_border
          to simplify definition of an area containing the whole topology.
        - interface:[managed].[xx] and interface:[all].[xx] are
	  no longer supported.
          Define an area area:all, containing the whole topology and
          use it to define an equivalent set of interafces:
          interface:[managed & area:all].[xx] and interface:[area:all].[xx]
        - any:[all] is no longer supported, use any:[area:all] instead.
        - 'every' objects are no longer supported, 
	  use network:[area:xx] instead.
        - Groups can now be used to define interfaces of pathrestriction.

        * newpolicy.pl:
        Better handling of different policy numbers from diamonds/netspoc/current
        and netspoc/POLICY

2007-10-09  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

        * Netspoc.pm: Introduced flags for services.
        Syntax:
        service:name = ip|tcp|udp|icpm|proto [number], [flag, ...];

        Wenn ein Service mit Flag in einer Regel angewendet wird, dann wird die
        Regel wie folgt veraendert:
        - stateless
        The rule is only applied to stateless devices.
        - reversed
        Source and destination are swapped.
        - oneway
	At stateless devices, don't automatically generate rules
	to permit answer packets.
        - dst_path
	The rule is replaced by n rules where the destination is
	substituted by interfaces i. i is defined by this rule: Take from
	each packet filter on the path from source to destination that
	interface i which is headed in source direction.  
	This flag can be combined with flags dst_net or dst_any to not get
	the interface but the corresponding network or 'any' object.
        - dst-net
        Substitute destination of rule by the containing network.
        'Any' objects are not allowed.
        - dst_any
        Substitute destination of rule by the containing 'any' object.
        - src_path, src_net, src_any
        Equivalent to dst_* flags but with source replaced.

        Results of get_any, get_path are cached for speed improvement.

2007-10-05  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * Netspoc.pm: Cache results of find_smaller_srv.

        * Netspoc.pm:
        Combine %rule_tree and %reverse_rule_tree into a single %rule_tree
        with additional attribute 'stateless'.

2007-10-04  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * netspoc: removed call to optimize_reverse_rules

2007-10-01  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * start-jobs: New file.

2007-09-21  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * Netspoc.pm: areas defined by anchor and auto_border:
        - don't access {intf_lookup}
        - set attribute {border}

2007-09-20  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * loginfo: New file.

        * newpolicy.pl: Reworked. can now run setuid.
	Doesn't any longer ask for log message but always takes "pxxxx".

        * append-commitlog.c, newpolicy.c, suid-cvs.c: New file.

        * cvs-log.pl: Parsed output is written to STDOUT

2007-09-13  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * cvs-log.pl: New file.

2007-09-12  heinz  <heinz@home>

        * netspoc:
	Don't use $FindBin::Bin because it doesn't run with tainting and
	is considered buggy. Instead use
	File::Basename::dirname(File::Spec->rel2abs($0)) and untaint its
	result.

        * Netspoc.pm: Sort networks with equal IP by NAT-IP,
        when printing routing and static commands.

        * Netspoc.pm:
        PIX global command: 
	If pool consists of one single IP, use "IP", not "IP-IP"

        * Netspoc.pm:
        Added two taint checks for the case when netspoc is running suid.

2007-08-31  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

        * newpolicy.pl:
        Add flag '-A' to initial "cvs update" to prevent usage of sticky tags.

2007-08-30  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

        * Netspoc.pm: Short interfaces (without known IP address)
        are no longer element of interface:*.[all]

        * Netspoc.pm: Enhanced command generation for PIX with dynamic NAT.
        If multiple networks are mapped to a single dynamic pool,
        now a single "global" command is generated,
        which is referenced by multiple "nat" commands.

        * Netspoc.pm:
        VPN3K devices can't handle access lists with check for ICMP type.
        Only simple ICMP can be checked for.
        Netspoc aborts now if it would generate code which VPN3K devices 
	can't handle.

2007-07-18  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

        * Netspoc.pm:
        An interface with multiple IP addresses is internally represented by
        multiple interfaces with exactly one IP address. These additional
        interfaces are called secondary interfaces. In previous versions, if
        an interface was referenced in a rule, all IP addresses are used.
        Now, only the first (primary) IP address is used. You have to add the
        secondary interface to get its IP address used.

        A Secondary interface by default gets a name which is derived from the
        name of the primary interface by adding an incrementing number
        beginning with "2".  E.g. interface:router.name.2,
        interface:router.name.3 .

        This naming scheme is used, if a list of ip addresses is specified
	for an interface. Alternatively, individual names can be given by
	a new syntax:
        interface:name = { 
	 ip = 1.2.3.4;
	 secondary:name2 = { ip = 1.2.3.99; }
        }

        * cut-netspoc: Added RCS $Id$
        Copyright 2007

        * netspoc: Copyright 2007

        * netspoc: Added RCS $Id$

        * index.html: Copyright 2007

        * TODO: crypto, vpn3k

2007-06-15  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Fixed a bug with "disabled" flag of interfaces:
	netspoc crashed if this flag was used at a non managed router.

	* Netspoc.pm: local_optimization: convert any objects to network_00
	only for $expanded_rules{any}

	* Netspoc.pm: Fixed a bug in path_walk.
	The case were two different loops touch each other directly 
	wasn't handled.	This can occur if one loop starts at a network and
	the other one at a router and router an network are directly connected.

2007-05-19  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Corrected errors when handling
	- disabled interface without attached network,
	- area with only disabled interfaces.

2007-04-10  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Added new pragma
	use open ':locale';
	which should work with both old style locale and utf8.
	This works for perl 5.8.6 and above.

2007-04-08  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* cut-netspoc: Handle attribute $router->{radius_servers}

2007-04-02  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Code cleanup in path_mark.

	* Netspoc.pm: Better formatting of time stamp

	* Netspoc.pm: New command line option "-time_stamps".
	Adds time stamps in seconds when printing compilation steps 
	in verbose mode.

2007-03-29  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* pre-lang.html: interface:[managed & area:name]
	Copyright 2007

	* pre-lang.html: Interface with negotiated IP.

	* pre-lang.html: Deny rules for any rules aren't generated any longer.

	Optimized implementation of mark_secondary_rules.

2007-03-20  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Different hosts inside a network must not have the same IP address.
	This isn't enforced for IP ranges.

2007-03-07  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	optimize_rules: shorter code.

	* Netspoc.pm: Added check_for_transient_any_rule.
	If we have a security domain any_A and two rules
	 permit XX any_A and permit any_A YY
	then this implies
	 permit XX YY
	which may not have been wanted.
	Netspoc now looks for this situation and aborts if the implied rule 
	is not explicitly defined.


2007-02-09  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Implemented more checks for vpn3k devices.

2007-02-07  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	Check for network_00 in find_chains

	* Netspoc.pm: IDs of hosts and networks no longer need to have a '@'.
	IDs of subnetzen always need to start with '@'.
	IDs of hosts must not start with '@'.

2007-02-06  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Disabled interface wasn't fully disabled when routing=OSPF.

	* Netspoc.pm: 
	- New attribute {interfaces} at virtual interfaces.
	- Pathrestrictions are added automatically for each set of 
	  virtual interfaces.
	- Special handling for paths starting or ending at an interface inside
	  a subgraph. For routing and pathrestrictions the interface must be 
	  handled as part of the attached network.
	  But for ACLs it must be handled as part of the attached router.

2007-01-19  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Sort networks of split tunnel list for vpn3k.

	* Netspoc.pm: auto_crypto: network must have exactly one network.

2007-01-17  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: find_object_groups / find_chains:
	used nat_map instead of bind_nat because both are equivalent 
	at a single router.

	* Netspoc.pm: find_object_groups / find_chains:
	clarified code in local function get_group / get_chain.

2007-01-16  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: print_acl:
	XRRP handling: better comment for $dst_range.
	protect own interfaces: swapped IOS/iptables, used elsif.
	Generate code: $name -> $acl_name.

2007-01-15  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: No tab in route command for IOS and PIX.

2007-01-04  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Removed unsed variable declaration and related comment.

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Error messages for identical networks or networks with undeclared 
	subnet relation no longer use name of NAT domain, 
	but nat:tag from original syntax.

2007-01-03  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Negotiated interfaces are no longer removed from auto-object-groups and
	from ther result of get_auto_interface.

2007-01-02  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Code cleanup.
	- New sub set_src_dst_range_list which fills new attribute 
	  src_dst_range_list of services. This is called from expand_services.
	- New attribute is used in expand_rules instead of repeated calls
	  to expand_splitted_services.
	- Extracted sub link_crypto_rule_with_tunnel from sub expand_crypto.

	* Netspoc.pm: Ignore disabled interfaces as crypto tunnel endpoints.

2007-01-01  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	and integrated additional tests.

2006-12-30  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Code cleanup.
	- Extracted code from sub setpath to new function 
	  check_virtual_interfaces.
	- Clarified arguments to call of setpath_obj inside sub setpath.

2006-12-04  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: 
	- Model VPN3K no longer needs to be managed 'secondary'.
	- In distribute_rule:
	  Mark VPN network with applicable vpn3k devices,
	  i.e. the first vpn3k device(s) on the path from src to dst.
	- Better formatting of XML code vor VPN3K.
	- Generate deny rules for auto_deny_networks at VPN3K.
	- Generate split-tunnel networks at VPN3K.
	- Check for maximum of 39 ACL lines at VPN3K 
	  (to prevent to large RADIUS packets).

	* Netspoc.pm: Fixed bug in auto_crypto, not only a network 
	but also a host triggers tunnel creation.

2006-03-01  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	- ignore unnumbered and negotiated interfaces from .[auto]
	- Better error-message for dst with mask 0.0.0.0 in pix static
	- only apply auto_crypto for traffic which passes vpn3k, but not if
	  traffic ends at interface of vpn3k.

2006-02-28  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	added support for IPSec attributes identity, 2x lifetime and
	authentication. But no code is generated for IOS 
	if default values are used.

2006-02-27  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	dropped support for IPSec attributes identity, 2x lifetime and 
	authentication.

2006-02-24  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Generally, no  auto_default_route is generated if a network 0.0.0.0/0 
	is defined. 
	This has been relaxed, if network 0.0.0.0/0 has a route_hint.

	* Netspoc.pm: IP / mask of network now can have value 0.

	* Netspoc.pm: added support of negotiated Interface.
	automatically add rules which permit encrypted traffic 
	of auto_crypto tunnels.

	* pre-lang.html:
	Added description for attribute 'routing=manual' of interfaces.

	* pre-lang.html:
	Added documentation for attribute no_crypto_filter of routers.

	* Netspoc.pm: Missing error if "any" object referenced unknown router.

2005-09-11  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Hub and spoke attributes must be used pairwise.

	* Netspoc.pm: Attributes 'hub' and 'spoce' of crypto definition
	may only occur once and pairwise. This has been changed to
	highlight the difference to attribute 'mesh' which indeed may be
	used multiple times to denote isolated meshes.

	* pre-lang.html:
	Added  "owner" to syntax of network, host, any and area.
	Introduced ", ..." as syntax element to denote a comma separated
	list of one or more elements. 
	Substituted <xxx list> by <xxx>, ...

	* pre-lang.html: Renamed interface_name to external_name where
	whitespace and quotes are no longer allowed.

	* pre-lang.html: Only interfaces of managed routers must be given
	as border for areas.

	* pre-lang.html: Added documentation for areas.

2005-09-10  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* cut-netspoc: Applied perltidy.

	* cut-netspoc: Better usage message.

	* netspoc.pod: Added description for new options. 
	Used some formatting codes.

2005-09-09  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc.pod: Added documentation for reading from STDIN and writing
	to STDOUT. 

	* Makefile: pod2html no longer generates bad html anchors. 
	Postprocessing with
	perl -pe 's/="([^"]*)">/($_=$1,tr.A-Za-z0-9#..cd,qq.="$_">.)/e'
	isn't needed any longer and indeed it rendered external links
	useless. 

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Interfaces of unmanaged router must not have attribute "managed"

	* pre-lang.html: Added description for "managed" attribute at
	interface level from branch.

	* pre-lang.html: added basic crypto syntax

	* Makefile: added cut-netspoc

2005-09-08  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

2005-08-31  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Added attribut {has_neighbor} to TCP and UDP
	services which have some adjacent range. Used this to imlement a
	more efficient optimization of port ranges.


2005-08-30  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Adjacent port ranges are automatically joined now.

2005-08-25  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Splitted handling of src and dst ports to get rid of
	the overlapping services problem.
	Added attribute src_ports to expanded rules.
	If srv holds a TCP or UDP service, src_ports holds another TCP or UDP
	service, typically a port range 1-65535.
	If srv is neither TCP not UDP, src_ports is set to protocol IP.
	All hashes of hashes over rules now additionally handle
	src_ports. No need for reverse services any longer. Now srv and
	src_port are simply swapped.
	Parser no longer uses $_ but $input instead.

2005-08-21  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Included patch about {link} in get_path from branch.

	* Netspoc.pm:
	No check for duplicate service needed in order_ranges, because
	this has been done in prepare_srv_ordering already.

	* Netspoc.pm: Remove unused subroutine check_less_equal.

2005-08-09  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	attributes owner, ip, range of host and
	attributes ip, unnumbered of network.

2005-07-14  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* pre-lang.html: 
	- language.html renamed to pre-lang.html
	- Table of contents removed; it is generated automatically by
          hypertoc now.
	- CSS added.
	- Ordered attributes of network:xx by importance, since attributes
          may now be given in arbitrary order.
	- Removed router:xx from "Referencing network objects".

2005-07-13  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Makefile:
	language.html is created by hypertoc from raw-lang.html.

	definitions: ip=x.x.x.x/n with n = prefix lenght.

2005-06-30  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* cut-netspoc:
	Handling of areas.

	* Netspoc.pm: Variable %areas exported.
	New function "is_area".
	New syntax "network:[area:xx]" and "any:[area:xx]".

	"every:xx" and "network:[area:xx]".

2005-06-29  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Introduced "areas". Syntax, marking enclosed
	security domains.

2005-06-21  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Only warning, not error for pathrestrictions with
	less than two interfaces.

	* cut-netspoc: Only print pathrestrictions with at least two
	active interfaces.

	* cut-netspoc: + gobal_nat
	Ignore internal groups from xxx:[all], there's no {src_code}.

	read_file.

	* Netspoc.pm: Export %pathrestrictions.

	* Netspoc.pm: Unknown networks in reroute_permit and subnet_of
	no longer abort but give a warning.

	* Netspoc.pm: Function get_path with an 'any' object as argument
	no longer returns a random network, but the network used in the
	{link} attribute. This gives a more deterministic result.

	* Netspoc.pm: preparation for new command "cut-netspoc":
	- additional symbols are exported,
	- read_file now uses STDIN if filname is "-".
	- Used "every" objects are marked with 'is_used' (like groups).

	* Netspoc.pm: Files are no longer read line by line but as a whole.
	{file} attribute is automaticaly set by read_netspoc for all global
	definitions.
	"include" keyword isn't supported any longer.
	read_file_or_dir gets an optional second parameter which defaults to
	read_netspoc. read_netspoc is exported now.
	This can be used to build a customized read_netspoc functions
	which is given to read_file_or_dir as 2nd parameter.

2005-06-09  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Generating iskmp commands for IOS + PIX.

2005-06-07  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	no managed router between src and dst.

2005-06-06  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Disabling parts of a cyclic graph is possible
	now. Virtual interface and pathrestrictions outside of a loop now
	gives a warning and no longer aborts.

	* Netspoc.pm: Prevent error when rules of hardware was undefined.
	THis occurs, if a managec interface gets no rules at all.

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Disabling of managed routers no longer gives a warning message.

2005-06-02  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Bugfix: secondary interface and find_related_rules: 
	Use ||= instead of |=.

	* Netspoc.pm: Attribute {loop_leave} of an interface inside a loop
	no longer uses an array but a hash to prevent duplicate
	interfaces. This is converted to an array after all interfaces
	have been collected.

	* Netspoc.pm: New syntax for port ranges from main branch.

	* Netspoc.pm: Added new routing type 'manual', which simply
	disables generating static routes and handles no dynamic routing
	protocol.  
	Interface of a network with mask = 255.255.255.255 is no longer
	checked for network and broadcast address.

2005-05-28  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Better error handling to prevent unhandled internal
	errors. 

	* Netspoc.pm: Unconnected Auto-Interface could cause an infinte

	Secondary or full filtering level may be defined individually at
	interface and as default value for all interfaces at router.

2005-05-25  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: isakmp, ipsec: values 'none' and 'off' are
	internally mapped to undef.	
	isakmp, ipsec: Identifiers of keys and values don't use '-' but '_'.
	Added internal services for natt and ah.	
	Automatically generated rules for tunnels now use info about NAT
	Traversal, IKE, ESP and AH.

2005-05-24  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Commands "crypto access-group" are generated now.

2005-05-23  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: $srv->{depth} has been deleted, it wasn't used any
	longer. 
	
	* Netspoc.pm:
	- New variable $use_nonlocal_exit which may be used to disable
          nonlocal exits. Disable them when using the perl profiler.
	- More efficient and more accurate functions and data structures 
	  for checking if traffic described by a rule goes (partly) 
	  through a crypto tunnel.

2005-05-06  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: - use '==', not 'eq', when comparing number of keys
	- set attribute {up} for interfaces and networks in sub convert_hosts
	- call expand_group for crypto rules with parameter convert_hosts=1

2005-05-05  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Merged Changes of branch: Bugfix for deny rules.

	- crypto: definition has attribute 'type'.

	* netspoc: added call to expand_crypto.

	* NEWS.html: spelling.

	* Makefile:
	Use current working directory instead of hard coded 'develop'.

	* VERSION, NEWS.html: netspoc-2.6 (released from branch)

	* Netspoc.pm: There was a bug in local optimization which has been
	introduced in version 2.2.  Some deny rules could unadvertently be
	marked as redundant, leading to missing ACLs for these rules in
	generated code. This bug has been fixed.

2005-05-04  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	No reverse rules will be generated for deny rules of protocol TCP.

	* index.html: Added reference to mailing list.

2005-03-22  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	  defined for a device.

2005-03-20  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Now read isakmp definition.

2005-03-05  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: added crypto map syntax for IOS

	* Netspoc.pm, language.html:
	New syntax for defining both, source and destination port:
	port:port or range-range:range-range.
	Old syntax with port->port did never work, because '->' has 
	same prefix than '-'.
	Better error messages for overlapping port ranges.
	Fixed a bug in expand_policies.

2005-03-04  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Rules which permit IPSec packets of tunnels are generated
	automatically. 

2005-03-03  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: PIX crypto maps

2005-03-02  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: path_walk works with crypto.

2005-02-16  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc, Netspoc.pm:
	Working on crypto.

2005-02-15  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* VERSION: netspoc-2.5

	* NEWS.html: Version 2.5

	* VERSION, NEWS.html, TODO: Version 2.4

	* Netspoc.pm: Access list for dynamic routing protocol checks for
	src network now.

	* language.html: Extended virtual interface definition.

	* Netspoc.pm: New and extended syntax for virtual interfaces of
	redundancy protocols. Access lists for multicast packets of
	redundancy protocols are generated now.

2005-02-01  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: A node inside a cyclic graph will never have an
	attribute {main}; only the starting point will have. This
	property is used to simplify code of path_mark.

2005-01-30  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Better handling of path traversal for a special
	case with interfaces inside a loop as src or dst.

	Example:
	        /-r1-\
	n0-r0-n1      n2
	        \-r2-/
	
	Be src=n0, dst=interface:r1.n1
	The only valid path is
	 n0-r0-n1-r1
	The old version generated a second path by mistake:
	 n0-r0-n1-r2-n2-r1
	because it didn't notice that dst has already been reached when
	traversing n1. 
	This bug has been fixed.

2005-01-29  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Cleanup of NAT code.

2005-01-27  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* VERSION: netspoc-2.3

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Fixed a bug in internal handling of NAT. This could lead to missing
	optimization of subnets and possibly to wrong code.

2005-01-24  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Bug fix: local_optimization no longer uses attribute
	'subnet_of', but 'is_in' for each NAT domain.

	* newpolicy: (c) 2004

	* netspoc, language.html, Netspoc.pm: (c) 2005

	* index.html: Copyright 2005, perl version 5.8

2005-01-23  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* VERSION: netspoc-2.2

	* Netspoc.pm: no_object_groups -> no_group_code, will be observed
	by chains as well.

	* CSPM.pod: added: Written at 2002/03/11.

	* language.html: auto_default_route is disabled for routers with
	dynamic routing enabled.

	* language.html: subnet_of may be declared for NAT definitions.

	* language.html: Rules with an 'any' object as src and dst may be
	defined now.

	* language.html: + global NAT

2005-01-22  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* language.html: name: + hyphen

	* language.html: + no_group_code

	* language.html: pathrestriction: Only interfaces of managed
	routers may be referenced.

	* language.html: removed [ static_manual; ]

	* language.html: any:[local]

	* Netspoc.pm: subnet_of: Prevent multiple error messages in
	different NAT domains.

	* Netspoc.pm: Allow virtual IP to be equal to physical IP.

2005-01-14  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Bug Fix: Don't jump out of path_walk, when
	collecting routes and statics inside a cyclic subgraph, because
	there is no defined order for traversing a cyclic subgraph.

	* netspoc.pod: Options can now be changed from command line; no
	need to change source code.

	* Netspoc.pm: Applied Getopt::Long patch from Stephane Bortzmeyer
	<bortzmeyer(at)nic(dot)fr>. Changed name of option
	warn_unused_groups to allow_unused_groups. Changed handling of
	tri-state options.

2005-01-03  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: NAT syntax: New concept of 'global NAT' definition,
	which is used to declare 'masquerading': A single, global NAT
	definition is applied to all networks located behind an interface.
	NAT syntax: Attribute 'subnet_of' may now be declared at local and
	global NAT definitions.

	An interface of an IOS router isn't protected automatically, if it
	is dynamically NATed at another interface of the same router.

2004-12-11  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: NAT syntax: Different networks may be translated to
	the same dynamic address space.

2004-12-07  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: find_subnets checks NATed networks as well.

2004-11-24  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Better internal data structure for NAT: NAT Domains
	and nat_map.

2004-11-21  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Check, that an 'any' or 'every' object is not linked
	to a router without interfaces.

2004-11-20  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Introduced a 'debug' function.

2004-11-13  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: path_walk: If destination is an interface which is
	directly connected to a network at loop entry, then walk directly
	to destination and don't use other paths inside this cyclic graph.

2004-10-21  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Validate dynamic NAT for every rule when it is distributed to a
	managed router. If a host or interface of a rule lies inside a
	dynamically NATed network, but doesn't have a static translation
	of its own, we have to be careful. 
	At our current router we could only filter for the whole network,
	because there isn't any more specific address available.
	But this relaxed filtering should only be done, if there is
	another router on the path, which does a full filtering of the
	original untranslated address. Otherwise an error is raised.

2004-10-14  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: New attribute $any->{unnumbered} holds all
	unnumbered networks of a security domain. This is used in get_path
	if $any->{networks} is empty.

2004-09-08  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* netspoc: Optional argument '1' for expand_rules if conversion of
	hosts to subnets should be done.

2004-09-03  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Fix: Transfer NAT attribute from hosts to subnets.

2004-09-01  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Character '-' may be used in names of hosts and
	networks now.

2004-08-22  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Check for duplicate NAT definition.

2004-07-20  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	New concept of 'subnets' in internal data structures.
	A subnet has attributes 'ip' and 'mask', like networks.
	Multiple hosts with successive IP addresses are converted to a
	single subnet object. A host with an ip address range is split
	into subnets which cover the original range.
	Two subnets are in 'subnet_of' relation if one subnet contains the
	other subnet.

2004-07-13  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Substituted many uses of is_host, is_network, etc.
	by direct calls of 'ref'. For a large configuration, this reduced
	runtime from 156 to 150 seconds.  

2004-07-11  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: object-groups are enabled by default now; new
	attribute no_object_groups.

	* Netspoc.pm: Prevent multiple identical routes to different
	interfaces with identical virtual IP.

	* Netspoc.pm: Fixed bug with object-groups and NAT.

	* Netspoc.pm: Disabling: handle case, where topology is completely
	disabled.

2004-07-05  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Fixed small bug in link_topology: 
	A single network must not have both, a managed and a short
	interface. This must likewise be true for an unnumbered managed
	interface. 

2004-07-04  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Rules outside of a policy aren't supported any longer.

	* Netspoc.pm: Removed unused variable @reverse_rules.

2004-07-02  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Prevent multiple error messages about missing 'any'
	rules. 

2004-07-01  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Only warning, no error for "Virtual IP: Missing second interface"

	* Netspoc.pm: Generation and optimization of secondary rules
	now is done during local optimization.

	* netspoc: gen_secondary_rules -> mark_secondary_rules

	* Netspoc.pm: Optimization of NetSPoC code itself:
	- new global hash %ref2obj which maps a network object
	  (a reference) to itself. This is used to convert a hash key of a
	  reference back to the ortiginal reference. This simplifies code for
	  global optimization and for finding PIX object-groups and chains
	  of iptables.
	- Removed useless attribut dst_network.
	- Don't calculate attributes for static command repeatedly.
	- Don't calculate routing and static for unnumberd networks.

2004-06-30  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Syntax: router:xxx is no longer supported, use
	interface:xxx.[all] instead.

	* Netspoc.pm: Better handling of disabled parts of topology.

	* Netspoc.pm: Internally, an 'any' or 'every' object is always
	linked with a network.

2004-06-29  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Fix: static NAT entry was missing for outside NAT
	
2004-06-28  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Syntax: Pathrestriction must be bound to managed
	interface only.

	* Netspoc.pm: Don't handle interface specially in
	find_active_routes_and_statics.

	* Netspoc.pm: Changed code of global optimization to have similar
	structure as local optimization.

2004-06-27  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: local optimization for intf_rules, i.e. destination
	is interface of a managed router.

2004-06-26  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Added local_optimization.

	* Netspoc.pm: Enhanced local optimization.

2004-06-22  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Fixed a bug in local optimization: a locally deleted
	rule must not vanish at other routers.

2004-06-21  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: Result of auto interface must not be unnumbered or
	short interface. 

	* Netspoc.pm: Each router gets a local optimization of all rules
	which are distributed to this router.

2004-06-17  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: New: Chains for iptables, similar to PIX
	object-groups.

	* Netspoc.pm: Bug fix: the finishing 'deny any any' rule must
	still be inserted at the end of an ACL.

2004-06-16  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: removed calls to order_any_rules, repair_deny_influence.

	* Netspoc.pm: Cleaned up handling of any rules: Code for any
	rules is now inserted at top of ACLs, directly behind deny
	rules. This usually gives better performance, because any rules
	match many packets.

2004-06-15  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Function check_any_rules replaces convert_any_rules.

	* Netspoc.pm: Changed handling of 'any' rules. 
	No automatically inserted deny rules any longer.
	Instead, any rules are checked if global rule semantics and router
	semantics are equivalent.

2004-06-11  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* language.html: Added documentation for Virtual IP.

2004-05-11  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Better secondary optimiziation if path has loops.

2004-05-06  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: New test, that hosts and Interfaces don't have
	overlapping IP addresses. 

2004-05-03  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Changed order of operation during optimization, to
	get better results with managed interfaces.

	* Netspoc.pm: path_first_interfaces now behaves correctly, when
	src and dst are the same router or network.

2004-04-19  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Corrected handling of any:[local] when used in
	conjunction with auto: interfaces.

	* Netspoc.pm: Attribut 'static_manual' no longer supported.

2004-04-16  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: PIX: added missing "interface" keyword in
	access-group.

	* Netspoc.pm: PIX static/nat/global: now works in both directions.

2004-04-06  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: New syntax "any:[local]". 
	If src/dst is a managed interface, this may be used as dst/src and
	names the security domain which is attached to this interface.

2004-04-05  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: any any rules may be used now, if no additional
	'auto any rules' need to be inserted.

2004-03-25  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: better internal representation of hardware
	interfaces. 
	
2004-03-15  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	- error_atline + syntax_err with multiple arguments.
	- Syntax of routers: arbitrary order of attributes.

2004-03-01  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: object-groups ready.

	* Netspoc.pm: cleaned up NAT for object-groups.

2004-02-28  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm: object-groups for src + dst, no services.
	Problem: rules must not have 'any' object.

	* Netspoc.pm: object-groups first try.

2004-02-27  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* index.html: + Todo list, minor changes

2004-02-25  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* netspoc: call rules_distribution instead of collect_acls.

	* Netspoc.pm: Prepare object-groups:
	collect_acls renamed to distribute_rules,
	code generation for rules is done later, when printing ACLs of
	single routers. This allows us to generate PIX  object-groups and
	user definbed chains of iptables.

2004-02-24  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: eliminated "interface:ARTIFICIAL\@$net1->{name}"

2004-02-23  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* VERSION: netspoc-2.1

2004-02-21  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

2004-02-06  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* netspoc: Don't call warn_pix_icmp by default.

2004-02-03  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Abort if interface has network or broadcast address.
2004-02-02  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Better optimization of secondary and reverse rules.

2004-01-29  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Short interfaces may be defined at any network where
	no managed interface exists with static routing enabled.

2004-01-27  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm Implemented check for too restrictive path
	restrictions which disable all possible paths inside a cyclic
	subgraph. 

2004-01-21  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Linux: omit prefix /32

	* Netspoc.pm: Enabled optimization for rules with managed
	interfaces as destination.

	* newpolicy: set exit status correctly

2004-01-20  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: iptables completed

2004-01-19  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Linux: add for 'ip route add' was missing.

	* Netspoc.pm: Virtual IP must not be equal to some standard IP.

2004-01-07  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Support of general cyclic subgraph, restriction to
	simple loops has gone.

2004-01-01  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: virtual IP-addresses for VRRP / HSRP

2003-12-30  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: NAT is supported at all routers, not only managed.

	* Netspoc.pm: [auto] interfaces for non-managed routers as well.

2003-12-23  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Internal change: path_walk now traverses every
	router on a path, not only managed routers. Now we can bind NAT at
	any router and implement interface:router.[auto] for any router.

2003-12-17  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: new: interface:[managed].[auto], .[all],
	interface:[all].[all], any:[all],
	but currently not interface:[all].[auto] 

2003-12-09  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: NAT: code generation for PIX firewalls: 
	static,	global, nat 

2003-12-05  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* language.html: NAT Syntax included, but documentation is still
	missing. 

	* language.html: Documentation for reroute_permit

	* Netspoc.pm: New attribute 'reroute_permit' for interfaces.

2003-12-04  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Better error checking with NAT. 

2003-12-01  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	First version with NAT. Support for PIX staticis still missing.

2003-11-28  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: Disabled warnings about unenforceable rules.

2003-11-24  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Found interesting bug in perl 5.6: if 'v1' is used
	as hash key like {v1} it is converted into a version string by
	mistake. 

2003-11-21  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Optimization of reverse and normal rules.

2003-11-09  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: iptables: deny any any added

2003-11-06  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Code for OSPF is now generated machine independent.

2003-11-03  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: New function order_any_rules

2003-11-02  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Code for answer packets at stateless packet filters
	isn't generated on the fly any longer, but we use reverse rules
	internally.

2003-10-29  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Introduced tcp services with 'established' flag
	internally. 

2003-10-23  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Code changes ins prepartion of generating linux
	iptables code. Code for secondary packet filters isn't generated
	on the fly any longer, but we use now secondary rules internally.

2003-10-06  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: Implemented code generation for linux iproute

2003-09-29  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@local>

	* Netspoc.pm: New variable %router_info describes properties of
	different router models.

	* Netspoc.pm:
	When expanding a router to its interfaces, unnumbered interfaces are
	left out now.

2003-08-27  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: An attribute 'description' has been added to policies.
	A description is marked with 'description ='; the value is read until
	end of line is reached. A description is ignored by default.
	If the global variable "store_description"
	is set, descriptions are stored internally. This may be useful,
	when the Netspoc module is called from a reporting tool.

2003-08-26  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm: additional code for supporting OSPF fully:
	permit ospf <network> <network> for an interface where OSPF is
	allowed 

2003-08-11  heinz  <heinz@linux>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	New attribute 'file' contains filename, from which the element was
	read: router, network, any, every, group, service, servicegroups,
	policy, rule.

	* Netspoc.pm: show_read_statistics:  statistic for policies

	* Netspoc.pm, netspoc.pod: $allow_toplevel_rules = [0|1|'warn']
	Allow rules at toplevel or only as part of policies.

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Secondary filter: ACLs for return packets are always generated, even
	for ICMP.

2003-08-10  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Fixed some subtle bugs in optimization of automatically generated
	'any' rules with attached deny_networks. Only managed devices with
	multiple interfaces were affected. 
	See 2nd policy in examples/auto_any_deny. 

2003-08-03  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* VERSION, NEWS.html: netspoc-1.7

	* TODO: nested loops + path restrictions

	* Netspoc.pm: Refined last bug fix for secondary packet filters.

2003-08-01  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Netspoc.pm:
	A bug was fixed. ACLs for secondary packet filter were too permissive
	for rules having an interface of a full packet filter as source or destination.

2003-07-27  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* index.html: Source: netspoc -> Netspoc.pm

	* index.html: NEWS -> NEWS.html

	* NEWS.html: New file.

	* VERSION: netspoc-1.6

	* index.html: added News, removed Description, Homepage

	* Netspoc.pm: Fixed bugs in path marking of loops

	* language.html: Better overview for policies

	* Netspoc.pm:
	Now error messages are always tagged with "Error:" or "Syntax error:"

	* Netspoc.pm: Correctected number of argumnets when calling setpath_obj

2003-07-24  heinz  <heinz@home>

	* Makefile: addedd INSTALL file.

	* INSTALL: New file.

	* language.html: Added description and syntax of policies.
	Corrected syntax of network and service groups

2003-05-26  Heinz Knutzen  <heinz@netspoc>

	* newpolicy: new default path /home/diamonds

2003-05-23  Heinz Knutzen  <heinz@netspoc>

	* Netspoc.pm: introduced new syntax "policy" for grouping an
	naming rules.

2003-05-14  Heinz Knutzen  <heinz@netspoc>

	* Netspoc.pm: Warning message "unenforceable" isn't printed
	multiple times any longer for the same rule.

2003-05-12  Heinz Knutzen  <heinz@netspoc>

	* netspoc: now use "use lib $FindBin::Bin" to find Netspoc.pm at
	the same place where the netspoc executable is installed.

	* Netspoc.pm:
	For stateless cisco routers the source port isn't checked any
	longer for established tcp connections.

2003-05-08  Heinz Knutzen  <heinz@netspoc>

	* Netspoc.pm: splitted function read_data into read_file + read_netspoc

2003-05-07  Heinz Knutzen  <heinz@netspoc>

	* netspoc: Made a single perl module Netspoc.pm from most content
	of the netspoc program. Only the main program remains in file netspoc.

2003-05-06  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: bug fixed:
	"Exiting subroutine via next at /usr/local/bin/netspoc line 482"

2003-05-02  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Simplified tagging for paths from src to dst inside of loops.

2003-02-27  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Released: netspoc-1.5

	* netspoc: Always generate duplicate routing entries in loops.

2003-02-26  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* language.html: updated

2003-02-18  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: $auto_default_route may only be activated if no
	network 0.0.0.0 exists. 

2003-02-16  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Warning if different interfaces have identical IP
	addresses. 

2003-02-15  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: New attribute 'routing' for interfaces of managed routers.
	Possible value is currently only 'OSPF'.
	When given, this disables generation of static routes for this
	interface and adds access-list entries to permit IP packets to
	addresses 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6 from any for this interface.

	* netspoc: attribute 'routing_manual' of routers is replaced by
	attribute 'routing' of interfaces.

2003-02-14  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: auto_default_route is only done, if at least
	two routing entries can be replaced by a default route.

2003-01-30  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: New option $auto_default_route to optimize the number
	of routing entries per router. 
	For each router find the hop, where the largest number of routing
	entries points to and replace them with a single default route. 

2002-12-11  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Implemented "secondary packet filters".
	In a given topology we may have chains of managed packet filters
	on the path from src to dst. Each packet filter is a "full packet
	filter" by default, which does full filtering for each rule 
	again and again.
	A secondary packet filter has simpler rules for	permitted traffic
	which gets further filtering by a full packet filter. In this
	case it allows any ip packets from src network to dst network.   
	A secondary packet filter is declared by the attribute
	"managed = secondary". This may be useful if a router has not
	enough memory for storing a complete set of filter rules.

2002-12-10  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: CVS working files: ^.# -> ^\.#

	* netspoc: new attribute for routers: routing_manual

2002-12-05  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Topology allows simple loops now. Loops may not be
	nested and may not touch each other. Still some caveats with loops;
	see TODO.

	* newpolicy:
	Check for updated and checked in working directory now uses "update -d"

2002-11-13  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Bug fix.  
	If there were only rules allowing traffic from src to dst, but no
	rules for traffic back from dst to dsrc, then no routing entries
	from dst to src were generated. This wasn't correct, since traffic
	back to src may be allowed implicitly by stateful packet filters.

2002-08-28  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc.pod, netspoc: variable $strict_subnets now may have values
	0, 'warn' or 1. If set to 'warn', netspoc warns about undeclared
	subnet relations.

2002-07-24  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc:
	NetSPoC didn't complain if an 'any' object was linked to an unknown
	router object.

2002-07-23  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Released netspoc-1.4

	* expamles: added auto-any-deny

	* VERSION: netspoc-1.4

2002-07-20  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc:
	Fixed bug in optimization: deny_networks from rules with auto_any
	objects were never been deleted, even if traffic was explicitly
	allowed by another rule. This bug was introduced in version 1.1.

2002-07-12  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Fixed small bug in order_ranges. This bug was
	introduced in version 1.3.

2002-07-11  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* VERSION: netspoc-1.3

	* language.html: Added syntax for source port ranges

	* netspoc:
	No special handling for source ports at stateless IOS routers any
	longer. Answer packets for udp and tcp are allowed to any port.

2002-07-09  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* netspoc: Handling of src port in services

2002-07-04  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Better comments in generated code

2002-05-02  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Support for stateless IOS.
	Warning: Switched names for router models:
	Old: 'IOS' was IOS router with Firewall Feature Set
	New: 'IOS' is normal IOS router, 'IOS_FW' is IOS router with FFS

	* Routing to unnumbered networks now works

	* Unnumbered network must be connected to at most two interfaces

	* Less errors messages, if network for interface is missing

2002-04-29  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Automatic protection of managed interfaces is ready.
	Using new attribute if_code

2002-04-25  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Script newpolicy:
	- calling cvs directly without a shell to prevent problems with quotes
	  in message texts
	- fixed bug in setting home directory

	* First try of automatic protection of IOS router interfaces

	* Bug fix: hosts shouldn't be allowed in unnumbered networks
	
	* Deleted rules now have a reference to the rule which caused 
	the deletion. This eases debugging.

2002-04-07  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>

	* Released netspoc-1.1
	
2002-04-02  Heinz Knutzen  <hk@home>
