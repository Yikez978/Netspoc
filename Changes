- Print host NAT first if used together with dynamic NAT.
  Print host NAT for ASA 8.4 with line number 1.
- Allow simple protocol descriptions like 'tcp <port>' directly in rules and 
  protocolgroups now.
- Attribute 'type' of virtual interfaces is optional now. If omitted, 
  no code to permit the redunancy protocol is generated.
- New attribute 'subnet' for hosts as alternate syntax to define a range.
  Syntax is "subnet = ip/{prefix|mask}".
- Generalized reading of mask for network and nat.
  Added ip = i.i.i.i/m.m.m.m as valid syntax.
- Disabled old syntax srv, service, servicegroup.
  Old syntax can still be enabled using command line switch 'old_syntax'.
- Prepare migration of keyword 'policy' to 'service'.
  We will change 'policy:' to 'service:'. This version allows both
  keywords interchangeable.
- Fixed bug in parser which allowed accepted names like type:xx:name 
  by mistake.
- Fixed another occurence of bug #108480 in perl versions 5.14.*.

3.006     2012-02-06 14:12:09 Europe/Berlin
- Support new radius_attribute "authorization-required"
  for tunnel-group general-attributes.
- We will migrate 'service' to 'protocol', 'srv' to 'prt', 'servicegroup'
  to 'protocolgroup'. This version allows both keywords interchangeably.

3.005     2012-01-31 16:53:10 Europe/Berlin
- Fixed dynamic NAT for ASA 8.4, use range and host in out-objects.
- Support new radius_attributes 
  authorization-server-group, username-from-certificate 
  for tunnel-group general-attributes. 
- Fixed check for overlap of interface with subnet.
- Added workaround for bug #108480 of perl 5.14 series.

3.004     2012-01-24 18:22:13 Europe/Berlin
