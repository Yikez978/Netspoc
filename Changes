- Syntax for aggregates is extended to have an optional ip/mask
  any:X = { link = network:Y; ip = i.i.i.i/n; }
  If no ip is given, it defaults to 0/0.
  This generates aggregated ACLs with ip/mask, 
  effectively allowing all matching networks to pass.
- Automatic group  network:[any:X]  holds all networks matching any:X 
  inside the security zone, where any:X is defined.
- Attribute 'route_hint' of network is changed to 'has_subnets'.
  This allows the network to have subnets.
  Networks with 'has_subnets' can now be used in rules and are allowed 
  to have hosts.
- Improvements in checks for missing rules on path:
  - checks are applied now to all rules having supernets 
    as source or destination.
  - checks for automatically generated reverse rules at stateless devices
    are left out, if there is some stateful managed device on path.
  - if only a single network matches in a zone, it is sufficient 
    to have a rule with this single network. 
    It is no longer required to use an aggregate with the same size 
    as in the original rule.
- The modifier 'no_check_supernet_rules' can be added to protocol definitions.
  This disables check for missing rules for rules having such a protocol.
- Redundant rules from networks in subnet relation are detected now 
  and a warning is given.
- Attribute 'owner' is inherited from a network to its subnets.
- Networks in subnet relation are checked to have consistent NAT definition.

- Added support for two or more networks behind EZVPN devices.
- Certificate name is stored now in attribute 'id' 
  of remote tunnel interface and now longer at the remote network.
  Old syntax is still suported.

3.008     2012-03-06 16:53:55 Europe/Berlin

- Added support for anyconnect clients of ASA 8.4.
- Added flag 'disabled' to disable a service.
- Copy raw files to output directory for better integration 
  with Netspoc-Approve.
- Check for unused raw files. 
  Check can be configured using option '-check_raw=0|1|warn'.
- Added option '-check_unused_protocols=0|1|warn'.
- Check overlapping ranges for consistent owner.
- Disabled old syntax 'policy:'.
  Old syntax can still be enabled using command line switch 'old_syntax'.
- Added option '-owner' to command 'print-group'.

3.007     2012-02-20 15:54:32 Europe/Berlin
- Print host NAT commands first if used together with dynamic NAT.
  Print host NAT for ASA 8.4 with line number 1.
- Allow simple protocol descriptions like 'tcp <port>' directly in rules and 
  protocolgroups now.
- Attribute 'type' of virtual interfaces is optional now. If omitted, 
  no code to permit the redunancy protocol is generated.
- New attribute 'subnet' for hosts as alternate syntax to define a range.
  Syntax is "subnet = ip/{prefix|mask}".
- Generalized reading of mask for network and nat.
  Added ip = i.i.i.i/m.m.m.m as valid syntax.
- Disabled old syntax srv, service, servicegroup.
  Old syntax can still be enabled using command line switch 'old_syntax'.
- Prepare migration of keyword 'policy' to 'service'.
  We will change 'policy:' to 'service:'. This version allows both
  keywords interchangeable.
- Fixed bug in parser which allowed accepted names like type:xx:name 
  by mistake.
- Fixed another occurence of bug #108480 in perl versions 5.14.*.

3.006     2012-02-06 14:12:09 Europe/Berlin
- Support new radius_attribute "authorization-required"
  for tunnel-group general-attributes.
- We will migrate 'service' to 'protocol', 'srv' to 'prt', 'servicegroup'
  to 'protocolgroup'. This version allows both keywords interchangeably.

3.005     2012-01-31 16:53:10 Europe/Berlin
- Fixed dynamic NAT for ASA 8.4, use range and host in out-objects.
- Support new radius_attributes 
  authorization-server-group, username-from-certificate 
  for tunnel-group general-attributes. 
- Fixed check for overlap of interface with subnet.
- Added workaround for bug #108480 of perl 5.14 series.

3.004     2012-01-24 18:22:13 Europe/Berlin
- Added support for changed NAT commands of ASA version 8.4.
